Hello github user,
This project uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) v8 to detect objects of interest in the given pictures. You can check the results in the code which I've provided. 
The dataset used in the project with the object of interest labelled is available on my Roboflow account: https://universe.roboflow.com/pranay-bisht-jadts/object-detection-dataset-in-post-flood-scenarios
The dataset of the flooded images is originally taken from kaggle. The object of interest selected for this project are: [car, person, heavy vehicle, bike]
